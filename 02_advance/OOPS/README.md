## There are four main OOP concepts in Python:

    1. Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the process of hiding the internal details of an object from
the outside world, and providing a public interface for interacting with the object. In Python, we can use access modifiers (such as public, private, and protected) to control access to an object's attributes and methods.

2.  Inheritance: Inheritance is the process of creating a new class that is a modified version of an existing class. The new class inherits all the attributes and methods of the existing class, and can also add new attributes and methods or modify the behavior of existing methods.

3.  Polymorphism: Polymorphism is the ability of objects of different classes to be used interchangeably, as long as they implement a common interface. In Python, we can use inheritance and interfaces (which are implemented using abstract classes or interfaces) to achieve polymorphism.

4.  Abstraction: Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable parts. In Python, we can use abstract classes and interfaces to define a common interface for a group of related classes, without specifying their implementation details.

These four concepts are the building blocks of object-oriented programming in Python, and they are used to create complex programs that are easy to maintain and extend.
