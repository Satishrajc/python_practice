1. What are nolocal and global keywords used for?
>> These two keywords are used to change the scope of a previously declared variable.
nolocal is often used when you need to access a variable in a nested function

2. What is the difference between classmethod and staticmethod?
>> Both of them define a class method that can be called without instantiating an object of the class.
class A:
    @staticmethod
    def func1():
        pass
    @classmethod
    def func2(cls):
        pass

3. What is GIL and what are some of the ways to get around it?
>> GIL stands for the Global Interpreter Lock and it is a mechanism Python is using for concurrency.
It is built in deep into Python system and it is not possible at the moment to get rid of it.
The major downside of GIL is that it makes threading not truly concurrent. It locks the interpreter,
and even though it looks like you are working with threads, they are not executed at the same time,
resulting in performance losses. Here are some ways of getting around it:

- multiprocessing module. It lets you spawn new Python processes and manage them the same way you would manage threads
- asyncio module. It effectively enables asyncronous programming and adds the async/await syntax. While it does not solve the GIL problem, it will make the code way more readable and clearer.
- Stackless Python. This is a fork of Python without GIL. It’s most notable use is as a backend for the EVE Online game.

4. çWhat are metaclasses and when are they used?
>> Metaclasses are classes for classes. A metaclass can specify certain behaviour that is common for many classes for cases
when inheritance will be too messy. One common metaclass is ABCMeta, which is used to create
abstract classes.


5. Function with type annotations
>>
def func1(x: int, y: str) -> bool:
    return False


6. What are generator functions? Write your own version of range
>> def range(start, end, step):
    cur = start
    while cur > end:
        yield cur
        cur += ste

7. What are *args and **kwargs in Python functions?
>> It used to send if you have variable length of arguments r=to send to function
one start(*) is used for list and two stars(**) used for dictionary

8. What are .pyc files used for?
>> .pyc files contain Python bytecode, same way as .class files in Java. Python is still considered an
interpreted language, though, since this compilation phase occurs when you run the program, while in Java
these a clearly separated.


9. 4. What will the maximum length of an identifier?
>> There is no certain length for Identifier; Identifier can be of any length.

10. Explain Memory Management in Python?
>> Python memory is management is done by python private heap space. All the objects and data structures of pythons are
located in a private heap.

10 .How to share global variable in Python?
>> By creating a config file and store the global variable to be shared across modules.

11. What is Lambda form in Python?
>> Lambda keyword is used to create small random anonymous throw-away functions.
# lambda argument(s): expression
fuc = lambda x : x * X
fun(10) --> output : 100

12. What is Pickling in Python?
>> Pickle is a standard module that serializes and de-serializes a Python object structure.
